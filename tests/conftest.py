"""Fixtures for pytest-based units.

Constants and helper functions can also be defined here. Doing so seems to
necessitate provision of an __init__.py file in this tests/ directory
such that Python considers it a package, but if that's already in place and
test execution is not deleteriously affected, then it should be no problem.
